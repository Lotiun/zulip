# Mute a stream

Messages from muted streams do not show up in **All messages** or generate
notifications, unless you are
[mentioned](/help/mention-a-user-or-group). Messages from muted streams
do not generate [alert word](/help/pm-mention-alert-notifications#alert-words) notifications.

Muted streams still appear in the left sidebar, though they are grayed out.

    **Note**: Some parts of the Zulip experience may start to degrade
    if you receive more than a few hundred muted messages a day.
